tuning_curve:

			mean:                                   The mean response at each contrast (vector, 1 x number of contrasts shown)
			stddev:                                 The standard deviation of response at each contrast (vector)
			stderr:                                 The standard error of response at each contrast	(vector)

significance:

			across_stimuli_anova_p:                 The p-value of ANOVA test across the visual stimuli; indicates if there is any evidence of differences in mean responses across the stimuli

			naka_rushton_RBN_relative_max_gain:	The relative max gain (maximum slope of fit if maximum response is normalized to 1)
			naka_rushton_RBN_saturation_index:	The saturation index (R(Cmax) - R(1))/(R(Cmax)-R(0)). Always 0 for 3-parameter version.

								    of [1..10] standard deviations of the control response. If the standard deviation of
								    the control response is 0, then it is recalculated assuming the response is 1 unit
								    per trial.
