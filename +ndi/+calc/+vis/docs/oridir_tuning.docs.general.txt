This calculator object computes several index values and fits of orientation and/or direction tuning given a set of stimulus responses at a range of stimulus angles as described in Mazurek et al. (2014)

There are two major types of indexes returned. One set are "fitless" index values that use vector methods to identify the preferred orientation and direction and the degree of tuning (such as circular variance and circular variance in direction space).

The data are also fit to a double Gaussian function of the form:

R(theta) = C + Rpe^(-ang_dir*(theta - theta_pref)^2) / (2*sigma^2) + Rne^(-ang_dir*(theta + 180 - theta_pref)^2) / (2*sigma^2)

where the fit parameters are 
         Rsp       - the untuned responseof the neuron
         Rp        - the above-offset response to the preferred orientation
         thetaPref - the stimulus angle that evokes the maximum response
         sigma     - the tuning width parameter
         Rn        - the above-offset response to the null direction
         C         - the offset constant
         ang_dir   - ang_dir(x) = min(x, x-360, x+360)
