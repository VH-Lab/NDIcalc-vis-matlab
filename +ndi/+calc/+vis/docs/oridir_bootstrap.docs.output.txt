The oridirbootstrap_calc document has the following fields:


input_parameters:
	iterations:					The number of simulations that were performed
depends_on:
	orientation_direction_tuning_id			The orientation/direction tuning document on which the calculations were based.
oridir_bootstrap_calc:
	direction_fit_parameters:			[NumSims x 5] matrix of fit parameters [Rsp Rp Op sigm Rn] for each simulation
	oridir_bootstrap_fits:				[NumSims x 360] matrix of fit value at each angle
