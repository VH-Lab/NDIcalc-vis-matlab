This calculator object computes three fits of contrast tuning given a set of stimulus responses at a range of contrast values as described in Naka and Rushton 1966, Albrecht and Hamilton 1982, and Peirce 2007. 

The three fit functions are modified Naka-Rushtan functions of the form 

R(c) = Rm*c/(C50+c)
R(c) = Rm*c^n/(C50+c^n)
R(c) = Rm*c^n/(C50^(s*n)+c^(s*n))

This calculator also returns an estimate of the C50 point by linear interpolation.
