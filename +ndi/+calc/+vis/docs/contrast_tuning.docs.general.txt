This calculation object computes three fits of contrast tuning given a set of stimulus responses at a range of contrast values as described in _____. 

The three fit functions are modified Naka-Rushtan functions of the form 

R(c) = Rm*c/(C50+c)
R(c) = Rm*c^n/(C50+c^n)
R(c) = Rm*c^n/(C50^(s*n)+c^(s*n))

wherein the fit parameters 

intit_rmax is the initial rmax search point
min_rmax is the minimum rmax value 
max_rmax is the maximum rmax value 
initc50 is the initial C50 search point that is contrast value with the response closest to the empircal max/2 
mi_c50 is the minimum C50 value 
max_c50 is the maximum C50 value 
init_N is the inital value for N
min_N is the minimum value for N 
max_N is the maximum value for N 
init_S is the initial value for S 
min_S is the minimum value for S 
max_S is the maximum value for S
