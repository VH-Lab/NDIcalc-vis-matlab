By default, this ndi.calc.vis.spatial_frequency_tuning object looks for stimulus_tuningcurve documents that have 'spatial_frequency' as the exclusive independent_variable_label fields of the stimulus_tuningcurve with no other independent_variable_label entries. That is, this calculation object searches for stimulus_tuningcurve documents that have variation in 'angle' and nothing more.

If one wished to restrict this further, one might add an additional condition to the default query.

Example:
% Only perform the operation on the element called myelement

DQ = c.default_search_for_input_parameters();
DQ.query = DQ.query & ndi.query('','depends_on','element_id',myelement);
c.run('Replace',DQ);
