The orientation direction tuning document has the following fields:

properties:
		coordinates:                   	The orientation/direction coordinate basis, can be "compass" or "cartesian"
		response_units:		       	The units of the response
	      	response_type:		       	The category of the response (e.g. "mean")
tuning_curve:
         	direction:                     	The set of direction angles tested, in degrees (1xN vector)
         	mean:				The mean response to each direction (note that these responses may be normalized or control-subtracted)
	      	stddev:				The standard deviation of the response to each direction
	      	stderr:				The standard error of the mean of the response to each direction
         	individual:			The individual response values for each direction (note that these responses may be normalized or control-subtracted)
	      	raw_individual:			The unprocessed generated response values for each direction (without blank subtraction or normalization)
	      	control_individual:		The response values to the control stimuli (such as a blank screen with the same duration as the stimuli)
significance:
         	visual_response_anova_p:	The p-value relating the different mean response values between the raw and control groups
	      	across_stimuli_anova_p:		The p-value relating the different mean response values generated by different stimuli
vector:
         	circular_variance:              A value related to selectivity and tuning width, a classic quantity in circular statistics
         	direction_circular_variance:    A value related to selectivity and tuning width, differs from classic definition due to its presence in the direction space
        	hotelling2test:                 The value of the Hotelling's T-squared Test of whether the orientaion vectors and [0,0] are different
         	orientation_preference:         The orientation with the highest response in orientation vector space
         	direction_preference:           The direction with the highest response in direction vector space
         	direction_hotelling2test:       The value of the Hotelling's T-squared Test of the direction vector (quite insensitive)
         	dot_direction_significance:     The value of the "direction dot product test" that uses both orientation vectors and direction vectors to assess the direction selectivity of a cell (Mazurek et al. 2014)
fit:
    double_gaussian_parameters:                 The parameters used for the double gaussian function: [Rsp Rp theta_Pref sigma Rn]
    double_gaussian_fit_angles:	                A set of angles that forms the X-axis (angle axis) for the fit function (usually 0:359)
    double_gaussian_fit_values:	                The value of the response fit at each angle in double_gaussian_fit_angles		
    orientation_angle_preference:	        The stimulus angle of orientation that evokes the maximum response in the fit
    direction_angle_preference:	                The stimulue angle of direction that evokes the maximum response in the fit
    hwhh:				        Half width at half height, the angle difference that produces half of the response compared to the most optimal
    orientation_preferred_orthogonal_ratio:     The ratio of the response to the preferred orientation to the response at the orthogonal orientation (90 degrees away)
    direction_preferred_null_ratio:             The ratio of the response to the preferred direction to that of the null direction
    orientation_preferred_orthogonal_ratio_rectified:	 The preferred/orthogonal ratio except that each response is rectified so it cannot be below 0 (even after blank subtraction) 
    direction_preferred_null_ratio_rectified:	The preferred/orthogonal ratio except that each response is rectified so it cannot be below 0 (even after blank subtraction, for example)
