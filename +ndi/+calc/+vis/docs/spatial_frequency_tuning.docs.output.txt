The spatial_frequency_tuning_calc creates a document of type spatial_frequency_tuning_calc. The primary purpose of this document type is to hold a superclass document of type **spatial_frequency_tuning**, which has the following fields:

properties:
		response_units:		       	The units of the response
	      	response_type:		       	The category of the response (e.g. "mean", "F1", etc)
tuning_curve:
         	spatial_frequency:              The set of spatial frequencies tested, in degrees (1xN vector)
         	mean:				The mean response to each spatial frequency (note that these responses may be normalized and are usually control-subtracted)
	      	stddev:				The standard deviation of the response to each spatial frequency
	      	stderr:				The standard error of the mean of the response to each spatial frequency
         	individual:			The individual response values for each spatial frequency (note that these responses may be normalized and are usually control-subtracted)
	      	raw_individual:			The unprocessed generated response values for each spatial frequency (without blank subtraction or normalization)
	      	control_individual:		The response values to the control stimuli (such as a blank screen with the same duration as the stimuli)
significance:
         	visual_response_anova_p:	The p-value relating the different mean response values between the raw and control groups
	      	across_stimuli_anova_p:		The p-value relating the different mean response values generated by different stimuli
fitless:
         	L50:              		The frequency value below the peak where the empircal (unfitted) response dropped below half the maximum, if ever; if no such point occurred, then -Inf. 
         	Pref:    			The frequency value where the emprical (unfitted) peak response occured.
         	H50:              		The frequency value greater than the peak where the empircal (unfitted) response dropped below half the maximum, if ever; if no such point occurred, then Inf. 
         	low_pass_index:              	The response at the lowest tested spatial frequency divided by the response at the peak spatial frequency. The responses are rectified so they cannot drop below 0. Values from 0..1 or NaN (if 0/0) are possible.
         	high_pass_index:              	The response at the highest tested spatial frequency divided by the response at the peak spatial frequency. The responses are rectified so they cannot drop below 0. Values from 0..1 or NaN (if 0/0) are possible.
         	bandwidth:              	The bandwidth between L50 and H50 in octaves ( log2(H50/L50) ). Bandwidth is Inf if either L50 or H50 are +/- Inf.
